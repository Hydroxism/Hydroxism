Hi there.

I'm @FBQuail, and I'm a novice that just picked up coding as a hobby.

Right now, I make 3D and 2D games in Godot and collaborate with other game developers. I also work on the front-end of websites, manage 2 homelab servers, 2.5 websites, and a minecraft server. Aside from that, I just make a bunch of shell scripts because some things are easy and repetitive enough to automate. 

The "biggest" things I've made is Kass-bot (now Woofox) which is an administrative discord bot that can also do other fun and music related things too.
